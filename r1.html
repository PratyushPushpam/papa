    <h2>Lake Baraila Conservation: My Journey</h2>
    <p>In 1994, after completing my Master's degree in Sanskrit from Bihar University, Muzaffarpur, I returned to my village Loma, located south of Lake Baraila, which had long been known for flooding, waterlogging, and the severe hunting of migratory birds. Since ancient times, from October to March, migratory birds were freely sold in the local markets alongside fish. People from all walks of life would buy these birds, eat them, and send them to relatives and officials. However, after photographs, memorandums, press releases, and media coverage, in 1999, the Forest Department arrested two people selling migratory birds in Jandaha Gudri Market. Since then, open selling in the market ceased, though it still continues secretly, albeit on a much smaller scale.</p>

    <p>Farmers used to grow crops like country rice (Desharia, Darmi, and Singra rice) and wheat and tobacco in the fields near the lake until the lake dried up. However, the broken embankments of the Baya River to the south and the Noon River to the north, along with the shallow drainage canal built in 1946 that connects to the Noon River, caused severe flooding. The fishermen also blocked the drainage by constructing bamboo barriers, preventing excess water from draining out of the lake. As a result, the wheat and other crops could not be sown, and farmers gradually abandoned agriculture, migrating to other states for work.</p>

    <p>By January, the waterlogged country rice became a favorite food for migratory birds. It is noteworthy that Lake Baraila spans 3,100 acres, divided into 22 pieces, with 500 acres of government land and 2,600 acres owned by farmers.</p>

    <p>To address these issues, after completing my studies, I entered politics under the leadership of the then local leader and current Member of Parliament, Professor Upendra Kushwaha. In 1994, I joined the newly formed Samata Party (now JDU), which supported farmers, and later became the district president of Samata Kisan. I organized the district party and raised the issues of Lake Baraila at a meeting on October 16, 1998, at Gandhi Ashram. We submitted written memorandums to officials under the party's banner and also met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on August 7, 1998, to discuss the issues of farmers. I also participated in hunger strikes with Rana Gangeshwar and other leaders, meeting several senior politicians and ministers to discuss the concerns of Lake Baraila.</p>

    <p>In 1999, during a meeting with Central Agriculture Minister Nitish Kumar, I was advised to meet Menaka Gandhi. In the same year, I went to Delhi, met officials of the Ministry of Forests, and was advised to form an NGO. I later tried to register an NGO named "Tathagat Mahavir Lake Baraila Wildlife and Research Institute," but due to corruption and negligence, registration was delayed.</p>

    <p>In 2002, I distanced myself from politics but continued environmental and social work under the banner of the institute, conducting awareness programs and providing memorandums to the authorities. On November 10, 2003, I led a team to remove bamboo barriers from the canal, which allowed water to drain out of the lake, benefiting farmers who could now cultivate crops like wheat.</p>

    <p>In 2004, after the canal dredging, a central rural development minister, Raghuvansh Babu, initiated a project to provide grain in exchange for work. However, due to the inaction of local officials, the project was not sent on time, and it was canceled in 2006. Similarly, the National Lake Program in 2001 also failed to materialize due to bureaucratic delays.</p>

    <p>I continued to raise awareness about the protection of migratory birds and worked to destroy nets used to trap them. On January 17, 2010, when the Chief Minister visited the lake, I felt a sense of relief. During his visit, I had the opportunity to present a memorandum regarding the lake's development and the protection of birds.</p>

    <p>Subsequently, in 2014, the state government began focusing on the lake's development and acquisition. In 2015, I was appointed a member of the newly formed Bihar Wetland Authority and participated in discussions about the lake’s issues. In 2019, the lake was included in the Namami Gange project, and I received training as a Ganga Prahari in Dehradun. My organization was renamed the "Ganga Prahari Baraila Lake Wildlife and Research Institute" in 2024.</p>

    <p>In December 2017, I received the Environmentalist of the Year award from the Chief Minister, and in October 2014, I was honored for my contribution to the lake. In 2015, I was invited to join the newly formed Bihar Wetland Authority, and although the committee was dissolved after a change in government, I continued to work for the lake's development.</p>

    <p>Recently, there have been renewed efforts to address the lake's issues, such as mapping government land and identifying crops and ponds for development. The district administration and forest department are now involved in the lake's management, and I hope for concrete action to preserve the lake's existence. The lake is drying up again, and the government’s intervention is crucial for its survival.</p>

    <p>The Chief Minister is expected to visit the lake, and we hope for a solid declaration on land acquisition and the restoration of the lake’s previous state. Without land acquisition, the lake’s development will remain impossible.</p>
